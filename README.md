**Abstract:**   
Models of physiological systems facilitate rational experimental design,
inference, and prediction. A recent construct of regulated growth hormone (GH)
secretion interlinks the actions of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), somatostatin
(SRIF), and GH secretagogues (GHS) with GH feedback in the rat (Farhy LS,
Veldhuis JD. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 288: R1649-R1663, 2005).
In contrast, no comparable formalism exists to explicate GH dynamics in any
other species. The present analyses explore whether a unifying model structure
can represent species- and sex-defined distinctions in the human and rodent.
The consensus principle that GHRH and GHS synergize in vivo but not in vitro
was explicable by assuming that GHS 1) evokes GHRH release from the brain, 2)
opposes inhibition by SRIF both in the hypothalamus and on the pituitary
gland, and 3) stimulates pituitary GH release directly and additively with
GHRH. The gender-selective principle that GH pulses are larger and more
irregular in women than men was conferrable by way of 4) higher GHRH potency
and 5) greater GHS efficacy. The overall construct predicts GHRH/GHS synergy
in the human only in the presence of SRIF when the brain-pituitary nexus is
intact, larger and more irregular GH pulses in women, and observed gender
differences in feedback by GH and the single and paired actions of GHRH, GHS,
and SRIF. The proposed model platform should enhance the framing and
interpretation of novel clinical hypotheses and create a basis for
interspecies generalization of GH-axis regulation.
